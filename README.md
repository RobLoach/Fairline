# Fairline's Units for Unciv

Unit images for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) from [Civ II Scenario League](https://sleague.civfanatics.com), [Fairline](https://forums.civfanatics.com/members/fairline.14395/), and others.

## Development

1. Acquire one of the unit sets at the [Civ Scenario League](https://sleague.civfanatics.com)
2. Make sure the image has an alpha transparent layer
3. Use Aseprite to extract the sprite sheet with "Replace Color"
4. Split the image to sprites using "Import Sprite Sheet"
    - X: 1
    - Y: 1
    - Width: 64
    - Height: 64
    - Padding with H 1 V 1
4. Create the `Unit-1.png` for the primary colors, and `Unit-2.png` for highlights
    - To shift the colors, use Edit -> Adjustments -> Hue/Saturate
